multilabel_classification
=========================

Methods to detect data and label issues in multi-label classification datasets.

In multi-class classification, each example in the dataset belongs to exactly 1 out of K classes (e.g. if classifying animals as: {dog, cat, rat}).

In multi-label classification, each example in the dataset can belong to 1 or more classes (out of K possible classes), or none of the classes at all (e.g. if classifying animals as: {predator, pet, reptile}).
